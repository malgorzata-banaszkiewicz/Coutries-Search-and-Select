# Coutries-Search-and-Select

The app is written in React with CSS modules showing a list of Countries with flags and basic information. You can use a search bar to look for a given country or use a select to choose one. The app is based on a free API that is shown through the use of the async await function. You can choose between light and dark themes and use this app as a source of knowledge about countries' populations, regions, capitals, and flags.
